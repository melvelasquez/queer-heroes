        <h2>Harry Breaux</h2>
        <p id="first-p">When you meet Harry Breaux, one of the first things you notice is his accent.</p>

        <p>It's Southern, but the specific location feels just out of reach. It's not Mississippian, and not Texan either, but there's a distinct draw that's just subtle enough that if you know what you're looking for, you pick up on it.</p>

        <p>"That river would go right through Morgan City," Breaux said, with that distinct yet indescribable draw. "It's trying to break through and come back that way again. And the Corps of Engineers is trying to keep it from doing that. If it ever does (pronounced 'eva'), it would completely flood out of Morgan City.</p>

        <p>The river he's referring to is the Atchafalaya, and the city it would cut right through is Morgan City, Louisiana, the place that gave Breaux that distinct accent.</p>

        <p>Many people recognize Harry Breaux from his participation in the San Francisco Chronicle's "Last Man Standing," a 2016 project that focused on men in San Francisco who were surviving with HIV. He was diagnosed in the 1980s, and has been a seemingly permanent fixture in San Francisco's HIV positive community.</p>

        <p>"That was kind of my claim to fame," Breaux said.</p>
 
        <p class="bottom-p">There's a lot more to Breaux – not instead of his HIV diagnosis, but alongside it.</p>

        <h3>The Family</h3>
        <p class="second-p">The Breaux lineage goes back generations in Morgan City. His grandfather owned a sawmill that cut cypress trees to make ammunition boxes during various US wars. With ample wealth, he and his partner opened up a bank in the city.</p>

        <p>After his grandfather’s partner died, he took over the bank himself, with Breaux’s father running the mill operation until it closed. After the mill’s closure, Breaux’s father went to work for the bank.</p>

        <p>“So I grew up white, wealthy and privileged,” Breaux recalled. “Wealthy in the sense of Morgan City wealth, not like the Gettys.”</p>

        <p>Breaux admitted that he, too, was primed to take over the family banking business, if not for one detail:<p>

        <p>“I had that little glitch. The homosexual glitch.”</p>

        <p>That “glitch,” from Breaux’s perspective, is a little important.</p>

        <p>“In my memoirs and my story and stuff, people say, ‘well what’s the thread that runs through the whole story and all,’ and the thread is homosexuality.”</p>

        <p>When many of us talk about the evolution of our sexualities, we refer to getting a boner in class or having a wet dream at summer camp. Sexual exploration played out differently for Breaux, who remembers trying to give a guy a blowjob at the local school in the sixth grade.</p>

        <p>As Breaux’s sexuality became more and more public at his school, the bullying started. One fight got the principal involved, and a subsequent call to his mom revealed Breaux’s interactions with local boys. His parents sent him to Lebanon, TN, a town just outside of Nashville to attend military school. While his father had attended Catholic School, that wasn’t an option for Breaux.</p>

        <p>“I think my father was clear enough in life not to send me to Catholic school,” Breaux said. “Cute little queer boy? To priests? Not a good idea.”</p>

        <p>Breaux repressed his sexual desires throughout military school, dating various girls throughout his time at Castle Heights Military Academy. Though he was dating girls, Breaux knew that wasn’t the life he wanted to live long-term.</p>

        <p>“I have an acting degree and I still call that my best acting job.”</p>

        <p>When Breaux was a junior in high school, his father died of a heart attack, and he was expected to take over the family banking business. The expectations took him to Tulane, where he majored in Business Administration.<p>

        <p>It didn’t stick.</p>

        <p>He had a sister who loved business, but, being a woman in 1950s Louisiana, she was not entrusted with the bank.</p>

        <p>Next, he switched to engineering. The plan was to become a civil engineer, start a company working with the oil industry, “blah blah blah.”</p>

        <p>It didn’t stick.</p>

        <p>Breaux’s next option was to follow in the steps of his high school experience and join the military. Unfortunately, Breaux had a blood condition called Renal Glycosuria, which disqualified him from everything but the draft, meaning he would never become an Officer, which is a position all-but-guaranteed to people with his experience.</p>

        <p>“There’s a form I filled out in that room, and I asked the recruiter if he’d slide it back over to me,” Breaux said. “It was all true/false, and one of them said something like ‘do you have homosexual tendencies?’ I had put no because I knew if I put yes I’d never be able to go into the military, but in that room I changed it to yes. The recruiter’s jaw dropped.”</p>

        <p>This incident marked a turning point in Breaux’s life. Afterward, he returned home, came out to his mother and went back to school, this time as a theater major, moving to Utah to attend university on March 19, 1966.</p>

        <p>After graduating in 1969, Breaux moved back to New Orleans to take care of his mother, who was sick. Soon after, she died of cancer, leaving $150,000 to him through an inheritance.</p>

        <p>After his mom died, he gave away everything he owned in New Orleans and established a commune with some friends in Oregon, where he lived for six years, before selling it and moving to San Francisco.</p>

        <p class="bottom-p">“I needed to find a place that I could openly express being a homosexual as openly and as forcefully as I could, and San Francisco is that place,” Breaux said.</p>

        </figure>

        <h3>The City Then</h3>

        <p id="third-p">Breaux settled in the Castro neighborhood. He worked various jobs throughout his life in San Francisco, but it wasn’t his work that marks his time in San Francisco.</p>

        <p>When he considers his decades in San Francisco, Breaux remembers his first time visiting a bathhouse.</p>

        <p>“I remember, there were all these gorgeous men in towels and I was just flabbergasted by it,” Breaux said.</p>

        <p>He also vividly remembers San Francisco’s hippie movement.</p>

        <p>“It felt like we were part of the new leading edge. We were going to change the world, that was the whole philosophy of the Castro.”</p>

        <p>The Castro District, also known as San Francisco’s “Gay Village,” is situated in the Eureka Valley in San Francisco.</p>

        <p>During World War II, gay servicemen were dishonorably discharged from the Service into the Bay Area. During that time, the Castro’s community of gay men skyrocketed and it became a place where gay men could live out, proud lives.</p>

        <!--Data Viz -->

        <p>Breaux remembers vividly the Ritch Street Baths, a bathhouse located in the city.</p>

        <p>“It was fabulous. It had a bar, tables, a room with regular TV you could just hang out in…” Breaux said. “It was like three stories of gay fun.”</p>

        <p>330 Ritch St. was turned into a <a href="https://sfist.com/2013/03/26/330_ritch_closed_permanently_after/">nightclub before closing</a> in 2013 after a shooting.</p>

        <p>It was moments in places like the bathhouses that created the proud community that would come to mark the most vibrant points of Breaux’s life in San Francisco, even as AIDS began taking them away in the decades to come.</p>

        <p>While Breaux had stints of living in Southern California, Houston, TX and New Orleans, it was San Francisco that had a piece of his heart unlike any of the other places he’d lived.</p>

        <h3>The City Now</h3>

        <p>There’s a noticeable sadness in the way Breaux describes San Francisco – the city he experienced the most formative year of his life – today.</p>

        <p>“San Francisco has gone from, in my opinion, a leading progressive place. It’s given in to the cold, harsh edge and it’s become much more capitalistic oriented instead of this sleepy little wonderful town on the coast that was beautiful and inspiring.”</p>

        <p>Breaux doesn’t recognize the San Francisco of today as the same one that was a central place for artists, writers and thinkers. The city he sees today is one of “crass commercialism,” where he notes the leadership has sold out to get big corporations to come.</p>

        <p>He remembers the promises of “urban renewal,” and how, under its promises, neighborhoods like the predominately-Black Fillmore were decimated.</p>

        <p>“They were so welcoming to us little white privileged people and we’d go there and sit in the jazz bars and listen to it all.”</p>

        <p>The 1980’s is largely thought of as the decade that set the stage for the city as it exists today. During that decade, due to cuts in public assistance funding, increased population and skyrocketing home prices, thought of as the part of the “Manhattanization” of San Francisco, homeless populations skyrocketed in the city, and was largely met without an effective, structural response from local politicians.</p>

        <p>A 1996 <a href="https://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=CREATION_OF_HOMELESSNESS">essay by Randy Shaw</a> recalls how Dianne Feinstein, who was mayor at the time, “described homelessness as a passing phenomenon and relied entirely on short-term, expensive solutions.”</p>

        <p>It was also during this time that the various San Francisco neighborhoods were destroyed to make room for skyscrapers and other development that changed the structure of the city forever.</p>

        <p>These decades, Breaux remembers, were the beginning of the end.</p>

        <p>Today, Breaux still urges the city to spend more money to house people and take better care of its marginalized communities, but he “doesn’t see the advocating doing much good.”</p>

        <p>“I pity you,” Breaux says, fighting back tears. “It’s a fucked up system. All of it.”</p>

        <p>Despite those feelings, and at his age, Breaux still feels like he has a duty to give back to the world in whatever way he can. He’s appeared in various documentaries, he’s still a vibrant part of the Castro and he’s willing to talk about his life, struggles and hopes with anyone who’ll listen.</p> 

        <p>Breaux didn’t “change the world” like he, and many of his generation, thought they would. They didn’t solve world hunger or stop people from dying overseas. In some ways, though, that disappointment has humbled him. Now, instead of trying to change the world, he seems inspired to try and change the pockets of the world he can change.</p>

        <p>“I stopped giving to charity organizations,” he said. “I take a buck or five or ten or something and I just give it to the guy on the street. And I don’t care what he’s doing with it. If he’s doing drugs with it, let him do drugs with it. So what?”</p>

        <p>When he thinks about the legacy he’s leaving to San Francisco, to Houston, New Orleans, Morgan City and the world, he thinks in quite simple terms.</p>

        <p class=bottom-p>“If there was a tombstone epithet, it’d say something like ‘he tried. He did his best. He reduced the damage he could have made to the planet, to the people.’ I just don't want it to be worse because of me. It may not be better, but I don’t want it to be worse.”</p>
